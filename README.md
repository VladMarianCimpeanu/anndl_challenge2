# Multivariate timeseries classification :chart_with_upwards_trend:

## Introduction
This is the repository for the second challenge hosted by Politecnico di Milano for the Artificial neural networks and deep learning course in 2022.
In this task, we are required to correctly classify samples in the multivariate time series format. In other
words, 6 different time series are provided and the goal is to classify them with a single label among 12
possible labels.

## Dataset
The source of these time series is unkown, thus we can not apply any domain knowledge.

Here you can see the measurements:
